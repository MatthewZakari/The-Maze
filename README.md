# **The Maze 3D Game**

## **Introduction**

The Maze 3D is a raycasting-based maze exploration game created using C and SDL2. The game allows players to navigate through a maze rendered in a 3D perspective. The goal is to successfully explore the maze and find the exit. This project emphasizes 3D rendering through raycasting, following efficient coding practices (Betty coding style) and showcases my ability to create interactive, visually compelling experiences using low-level programming.

## **Installation**

To get the game running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MatthewZakari/portfolio-project_MVP-complete
    cd portfolio-project_MVP-complete
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** (Make sure SDL2 is installed on your system):
    - On Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
    ```

3. **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

4. **Run the game**:
    ```bash

## **Usage**

After starting the game, use the following keys to navigate:
- **Arrow keys**: Move the player forward, backward, and rotate left or right.
- **Escape key**: Exit the game.

Your goal is to navigate through the maze to find the exit. The 3D rendering simulates a first-person view of the maze.
